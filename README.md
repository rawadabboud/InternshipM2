Detecting Parkinson's Disease Using Machine Learning and EEG Signals

This project attempts to develop new diagnostic tools by combining machine learning algorithms with electrical brain signals, the electroencephalography (EEG). We tested different EEG signal processing features such as spectral and connectivity with various machine learning classifiers such as random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine, extra trees classifier. The comparative analysis is quantified based on several performance parameters such as accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity.

Our pipeline consists of four big steps:  
1- Acquisition of resting-state EEG signals of 108 subjects.  
2- Extraction of the spectral and connectivity features.  
3- Classification of PD and HC using five different classifiers.  
4- Evaluation of the algorithms' performances.
